# Claude Code Implementing Features

> This is a CLI project to track working hours

### Prompts

1.
```
1. Add feature where when the datasource.json is created we will have a new atribute called as "worked_hours", this attribute should be a map where the key should be a date on format of yyyy-MM and the value of the map should be other map, this other map should be with keys as the current month dates on format yyyy-MM-dd and the value should be by default 0.
2. Add this code to the main.py collect_user_data method
3. Not run tests
```

2.
```
1. Add a new @click.command named as "edit-worked-hours" where user can edit the worked_hours passing two params: day on format yyyy-MM-dd and an number of how many hours the person worked, if on "worked_hours" datasource the key yyyy-MM does not exist yet, please fill with same logic that was done previously.
2. Update the get_hours_per_day to calculate the hours that was already worked based on the "worked_hours" values and outputs how many hours left until completes the contract hours and also how much the person should do per day, also continue displaying how much was the initial estimative of how many hours the person should do per day.
3. Not run tests
```

3. 
```
1. Add a new @click.command named as "export-hours" where the input should be the day on format yyyy-MM and should create a csv file inside the "resources" folder with the hours worked on that month, the expected hours per day, how much was already done, how much is left and what is the current expectations to work.
